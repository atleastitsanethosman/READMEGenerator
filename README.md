  # Installation
  
  In order to install this application, the user will need to download associated files, and be sure to install nodeJS on their machine.  Next the user will need to navigate to the directory in their terminal and run the command ```npm i``` to install the correct nodeJS packages.  Following that, the user will need to run command ```npm i inquirer``` in the terminal in order to install the inquirer package.<br>
  
  # Usage
  
  User will need to navigate to the appropriate directory in their terminal after completing installation and run command ```node index```<br>
  They will then be prompted with a series of questions to generate a README file in a format much like this one. <br>
  A video demonstrating the application is available at the following link: [Demonstration Video](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XFdzehHPJqPhbaw2hLnJqzBLXNOyEcOo/view?usp=sharing>) <br>
  The application will output a file titled READMEOUT.md which the user can edit or rename and save as appropriate.
